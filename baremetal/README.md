# Baremetal Minux

A lightweight, ncurses-based file explorer with multi-tab support and modern features, designed for minimal resource usage and maximum efficiency.



## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

Before compiling and running the `minux` shell, ensure that you have the following packages installed on your Raspberry Pi:

1. **libcamera**: Required for camera functionality.
2. **ncurses**: Required for terminal UI.
3. **GPIO library**: Required for controlling GPIO pins.

You can install these packages using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcamera-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev pigpio
```

### Compiling the Program

To compile the `minux` shell, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the source code and generate the executable.

### Running the Program

Once compiled, you can run the `minux` shell with the following command:

```bash
./minux
```

### Testing the Camera

To test the camera functionality, enter the following command in the `minux` shell:

```bash
test camera
```

This command captures images using the Arducam camera and saves them in the `test_images` directory.

### Notes

- Ensure that the Arducam camera is properly connected to the Raspberry Pi.
- Captured images will be saved in the `test_images` directory within the current working directory.


## Technical Overview

### Core Components

1. **Window Management**
   - Utilizes ncurses panels and windows for UI rendering
   - Main components: menu bar, file panel, preview panel, status bar, tab bar
   - Custom window buffering for efficient screen updates

2. **Data Structures**
   ```c
   typedef struct {
       char name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
       char path[MAX_PATH];
       char *content;
       size_t content_size;
       int scroll_pos;
       int cursor_x, cursor_y;
       int modified;
   } Tab;

   typedef struct {
       WINDOW *win;
       char items[MAX_ITEMS][MAX_NAME_LENGTH + 1];
       int count;
       int selected;
       int start;
       int scroll_pos;
   } Panel;
   ```

3. **Memory Management**
   - Dynamic content allocation for file buffers
   - Automatic cleanup on tab closure
   - Buffer size limits: MAX_ITEMS (1024), MAX_PATH (4096)

4. **Cryptocurrency Wallet**
   - Secp256k1-based key generation and management

- Memory tracking
- Performance metrics
- Assert statements

## Known Limitations

1. Maximum file size: Limited by available memory
2. Maximum path length: 4096 characters
3. Maximum items per directory: 1024
4. Maximum open tabs: 10

## Future Enhancements

2. Plugin system
3. Custom keybinding support
4. Search functionality
5. Split-pane support

## Error Console System

### DOOM-Style Error Terminal
The system features a retro-style error console inspired by classic DOS games:

1. **Activation**
   - Automatically appears when errors occur
   - Toggle with `~` key (like classic DOOM console)
   - Dismiss with `ESC` key
   - Error history persists between sessions

2. **Visual Style**
   - Full-screen overlay with semi-transparent background
   - DOS-style monospace font
   - Color-coded error levels:
     - RED: Critical errors
     - YELLOW: Warnings
     - WHITE: Information
     - GREEN: Success messages

3. **Features**
   - Scrollable error history
   - Timestamp for each error
   - Error categorization
   - Command history
   - Error source tracking
   - Stack trace for critical errors

4. **Error Categories**
   ```c
   typedef enum {
       ERROR_CRITICAL,    // System-level failures
       ERROR_WARNING,     // Non-fatal warnings
       ERROR_INFO,        // Information messages
       ERROR_SUCCESS      // Success confirmations
   } ErrorLevel;
   ```

5. **Error Format**
   ```
   [TIMESTAMP] <ERROR_LEVEL> [SOURCE] Message
   Example:
   [2024-03-14 15:23:45] <CRITICAL> [EXPLORER] Failed to open file: Permission denied
   Stack trace:
   -> main() at minux.c:245
   -> launch_explorer() at minux.c:167
   -> open_file() at explorer.c:89
   ```

6. **Integration**
   - Errors logged to both console and file
   - Persistent error log in ~/.minux/error.log
   - Real-time console updates
   - System status monitoring

7. **Commands**
   - `clear` - Clear console history
   - `save` - Save console buffer to file
   - `filter` - Filter by error level
   - `search` - Search error messages
   - `help` - Show console commands

### Status Bar Integration
The Windows 95-style status bar provides:
- Current system status
- Last error message preview
- Error count indicator
- Quick access to error console

### Wallet Commands

The `minux` shell includes a built-in cryptocurrency wallet with the following commands:

1. **Create Wallet**
   ```bash
   wallet create
   ```
   Generates a new secp256k1 keypair and displays the public and private keys.

2. **Import Wallet**
   ```bash
   wallet import <private_key>
   ```
   Imports a wallet using an existing private key in hex format.

3. **Export Wallet**
   ```bash
   wallet export
   ```
   Displays the current wallet's public and private keys.

4. **Sign Message**
   ```bash
   wallet sign <message>
   ```
   Signs a message using the wallet's private key and displays the signature.

5. **Verify Signature**
   ```bash
   wallet verify <message> <signature> <public_key>
   ```
   Verifies a message signature against a public key.

## Camera Functionality

The `minux` shell now supports controlling the Arducam Day-Night Vision camera. You can capture images in both daylight and night vision modes using the following command:

### Command: `test camera`

This command captures images using the Arducam camera and saves them in the `test_images` directory. The process includes:

1. **Creating a Directory**: A folder named `test_images` is created to store the captured images.
2. **Capturing Daylight Image**: The camera captures an image in daylight mode and saves it as `daylight.jpg`.
3. **Simulating Night Mode**: The IR-Cut filter is disabled to activate night vision mode, and the camera captures an image saved as `night_vision.jpg`.
4. **Restoring Day Mode**: The IR-Cut filter is re-enabled, and another image is captured and saved as `restored_daylight.jpg`.

### Usage

To test the camera, simply enter the following command in the `minux` shell:

```bash
test camera
```

### Requirements

- Ensure that the Arducam camera is properly connected to the Raspberry Pi.
- The `libcamera` library must be installed on your system. You can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcamera-dev
```

### Notes

- The command also controls GPIO pins to manage the IR-Cut filter for switching between day and night modes.
- Captured images will be saved in the `test_images` directory within the current working directory.
